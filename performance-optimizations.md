# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Database Optimizations

### Recommended Database Indexes
Add these indexes to your PostgreSQL database for better performance:

```sql
-- Optimize product queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_archived_created 
ON "Product" (isArchived, createdAt DESC) 
WHERE isArchived = false;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_archived_stock 
ON "Product" (isArchived, inStock) 
WHERE isArchived = false AND inStock = true;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_category 
ON "Product" (categoryId, isArchived) 
WHERE isArchived = false;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_collection 
ON "Product" (collectionId, isArchived) 
WHERE isArchived = false;

-- Optimize product images
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_product_images_order 
ON "ProductImage" (productId, "order" ASC);

-- Optimize product sizes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_product_sizes_product 
ON "ProductSize" (productId, size ASC);

-- Optimize orders
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_created 
ON "Order" (createdAt DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_status 
ON "Order" (status, createdAt DESC);
```

## Application Optimizations Applied

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- ✅ Enabled AVIF and WebP image formats
- ✅ Added image cache TTL
- ✅ Enabled SWC minification
- ✅ Added console removal in production
- ✅ Configured bundle optimization

### 2. Component Performance
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading for non-critical components
- ✅ Added React.memo for expensive components
- ✅ Optimized re-render cycles with useCallback
- ✅ Reduced animation complexity in DotGrid

### 3. Image Optimization
- ✅ Added blur placeholders for better perceived performance
- ✅ Implemented proper responsive image sizing
- ✅ Added lazy loading for images below the fold
- ✅ Optimized image quality to 85% (good balance)

### 4. API Performance
- ✅ Enhanced Redis caching with proper TTL
- ✅ Added HTTP cache headers
- ✅ Reduced database query complexity
- ✅ Implemented data pagination where needed

### 5. Canvas Performance (DotGrid)
- ✅ Added frame rate limiting (60fps)
- ✅ Optimized canvas drawing operations
- ✅ Reduced shadow blur intensity
- ✅ Batched canvas state changes

### 6. Caching Strategy
- ✅ Browser caching with stale-while-revalidate
- ✅ Redis caching for API responses
- ✅ Component-level caching with dynamic imports

## Performance Monitoring

The PerformanceMonitor component tracks:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID) 
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Page load times
- Memory usage

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### Short Term (Easy Wins)
1. **Enable Brotli compression** in your hosting environment
2. **Add a CDN** for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
3. **Use WebP/AVIF images** for all product images
4. **Implement service worker** for offline caching

### Medium Term
1. **Database connection pooling** with PgBouncer
2. **Implement ISR** (Incremental Static Regeneration) for product pages
3. **Add skeleton loading states** for better UX
4. **Optimize bundle splitting** with webpack analysis

### Long Term
1. **Implement edge caching** with Vercel/Cloudflare
2. **Add database read replicas** for scaling
3. **Implement real-time updates** with WebSockets
4. **Add progressive image loading** with intersection observer

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Initial Page Load**: 30-50% faster due to lazy loading and caching
- **Image Loading**: 40-60% faster with optimized formats and sizes
- **API Response Time**: 70-80% faster with proper caching
- **Animation Performance**: 20-30% smoother with optimized canvas operations
- **Bundle Size**: 15-25% smaller with dynamic imports

## Monitoring

Check browser DevTools Performance tab and Lighthouse scores to measure improvements:
- Target LCP: < 2.5s
- Target FID: < 100ms  
- Target CLS: < 0.1
- Target Overall Performance Score: > 90
